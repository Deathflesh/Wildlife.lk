      <p>
        Sri Lankan leopards are highly adaptable. They are found in a range of habitat types, through from different
        kinds of
        forest, to grasslands and even in tea plantations and home gardens! They are effective hunters and take a
        variety of
        different prey items. They mostly prefer small deer, but will also eat wild boar, hare, monkeys, birds and
        even
        crabs
        and insects. This flexibility has allowed them to survive in a range of environments across Sri Lanka.
        <br><br>
        Less than 1000 Sri Lankan leopards are left in the wild. This is due mainly to conflict with humans ‚Äì human
        encroachment
        into leopard habitat, hunting of animals that come too close to human areas or interfere with farmers, and
        poaching for
        skins and other body parts.
        <br><br>
        The National Zoo and Aquarium is home to 4 Sri Lankan Leopards; Ankesh and Yakalla and their offspring Asanka
        and
        Chatura.

      <section id="habitat">
        <h4 class="threats-headings">Habitat Loss Threat ‚ö†Ô∏è</h4>
        <p class="threats-para">
          Habitat loss stands as a significant threat to the survival of Sri Lankan leopards. Human-induced activities
          such as
          deforestation, land conversion for agriculture, and urban development have drastically reduced the leopard's
          natural
          habitats. The shrinking habitats confine leopards to smaller areas, increasing encounters with humans and
          leading to
          escalated conflicts. These disruptions to their habitat greatly impact their behavior, foraging patterns, and
          reproductive success, threatening the overall well-being of the leopard population.
        </p>

        <h4 class="threats-headings">Consequences üõë</h4>
        <p class="threats-para">
          The consequences of habitat loss are profound for Sri Lankan leopards. The reduction and fragmentation of
          their habitats
          pose immediate and long-term challenges to their survival. As their habitats shrink, leopards face heightened
          competition for resources and space, resulting in intensified human-leopard conflicts. Additionally, the loss
          of crucial
          habitats fragments leopard populations, reducing genetic sectionersity and limiting their ability to adapt to
          changing
          environments. This disruption to their natural habitats significantly compromises the leopard's ability to
          thrive and
          perpetuates their vulnerability to extinction.
        </p>
        <h4 class="threats-headings">Prevention Methods üõü</h4>
        <p class="threats-para">
          Mitigating the threat of habitat loss requires proactive and collaborative measures. Implementing and
          enforcing
          stringent regulations against deforestation, land conversion, and habitat degradation are pivotal steps.
          Conservation
          initiatives focusing on habitat restoration, reforestation, and protected area management are critical in
          safeguarding
          vital leopard habitats. Engaging local communities through education, incentivizing sustainable land-use
          practices, and
          fostering coexistence between humans and leopards are essential strategies. Furthermore, promoting
          landscape-level
          conservation approaches and establishing wildlife corridors to connect fragmented habitats are crucial steps
          toward
          securing the long-term survival of Sri Lankan leopards amidst habitat loss.

      <section id="trade">
        <h4 class="threats-headings">Illegal Wildlife Trade Threat ‚ö†Ô∏è</h4>
        <p class="threats-para">
          The illegal wildlife trade poses a grave threat to the Sri Lankan leopard population. These magnificent
          creatures face
          the grim reality of poaching, targeted for their valuable skins, bones, and body parts. This relentless
          exploitation
          directly impacts the leopard population, driving them toward endangerment. Moreover, this illicit trade
          disrupts their
          natural behaviors and habitats, further exacerbating their vulnerability to extinction. The trade not only
          poses a
          direct physical threat to insectionidual leopards but also disturbs the intricate ecological balance within
          Sri
          Lanka's
          ecosystems.
        </p>

        <h4 class="threats-headings">Consequences üõë</h4>
        <p class="threats-para">
          The consequences of the illegal wildlife trade are dire for Sri Lankan leopards. The persistent poaching
          activities for
          leopard parts not only result in a decline in their numbers but also impede the species' ability to thrive in
          their
          natural habitats. Furthermore, this trade disrupts the biosectionersity and ecological equilibrium, leading to
          cascading
          impacts on the entire ecosystem. The loss of leopards from their ecological roles not only affects their
          survival but
          also influences prey populations and ecosystem dynamics, posing long-term consequences for Sri Lanka's natural
          landscapes.
        </p>

        <h4 class="threats-headings">Prevention Methods üõü</h4>
        <p class="threats-para">
          To combat the illegal wildlife trade endangering Sri Lankan leopards, a multifaceted approach is imperative.
          Strengthening law enforcement and implementing stringent penalties for poachers and traders is essential. This
          involves
          concerted efforts to dismantle illegal trading networks through increased surveillance, intelligence
          gathering, and
          coordinated enforcement actions. Raising public awareness about the consequences of wildlife trade and
          fostering
          community engagement are also crucial elements. Collaboration between law enforcement agencies, wildlife
          authorities,
          conservation organizations, and local communities is pivotal in effectively addressing this threat. Measures
          encompassing educational campaigns, stakeholder involvement, and policy advocacy are integral in curbing this
          detrimental practice.
